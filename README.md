# BetterVetSwerve

## Git
* The main branch is only for 100% tested, working code
* Merging dev to main should require at least one other programmer to agree
* Don't make commits directly to dev either, make a branch (ex: eh_cleaning_up_subsystems) and then PULL FROM DEV and deal with CONFLICTS ON YOUR END
* Please use ruff (for now only on needed files until things are cleaned up) before making a pull request to merge your branch to dev
* After merge delete your branch
